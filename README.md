Code to do the Condorcet voting for the things in my condo

It is built on https://github.com/jhpratt/python-vote-core and currently uses the Schulze Nonproportional Representation
as a ranking mechanism.

Usage:
```bash
python3 vote.py votes-in-this-file.csv
```

See example-votes.csv for the input it accepts.
